# OR-Project
This is an Implementation of some Operations Research Solutions with Matlab
<ul>
   In this Practical Work of Operations Research Module, we implemented: 
  
  <li>The search for strongly connected components of a connected graph by the marking algorithm</li>
  <li>Searching for a spanning tree of min weight by kruskal's algorithm</li>
  <li>The search for a spanning tree of min weight by Prim's algorithm</li>
  
</ul>
